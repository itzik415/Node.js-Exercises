// There are n people standing in line to buy show tickets.Due to high demand, the venue sells tickets according to the following rules:

// The person at the head of the line can buy exactly one ticket and must then exit the line.
// if a person needs to purchase additional tickets,they must re-enter the end of the line and wait to be sold their next ticket(assume exit and re-entry takes zero seconds).
// Each ticket sale takes exactly one second.
// We express initial line of n people as an array, tickets = [tickets0, tickets1 ... ticketsN-1], where ticketsi denotes the number of tickets person i wishes to buy. If Jesse is standing at a position p in this line, find out how much time it would take for him to buy all tickets. Complete the waiting time function in the editor below. It has two parameters:

// An array, tickets, of n positive integers describing initial sequence of people standing in line. Each ticketsi describes number of tickets that a person waiting at initial place.
// An integer p, denoting Jesse's position in tickets.

// Sample Input 5 2 6 3 4 5 2 Sample Output 12 Sample Input 4 5 5 2 3 3 Sample Output 11
function waitingTime(array, p) {
    let tickectsAmout = array[p];
    let result = 0;
    let personLocation = p;
    while(tickectsAmout > 0) {
        let reducedValue = array.shift();
		reducedValue--;
        result = result + 1;
        if(personLocation === 0) {
            personLocation = array.length;
            tickectsAmout -= 1;
        }else {
            personLocation--;
        }
        if(reducedValue > 0){
            array.push(reducedValue)
        }
    }
    return result;
}

waitingTime([2,6,3,4,5], 4)



// array = [2,6,3,4,5] 
// p = 0
//Answer: 6
